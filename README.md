## About Me
Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Venkata Sri Deepthi SriKotaPeetambaram, a passionate researcher with experience in data science, machine learning, and analytics. During my tenure as a Research Assistant at The University of Texas at Arlington, I contributed to several impactful projects that focused on leveraging data-driven insights to solve real-world problems.

## Research Projects

### 1. **Water Quality Monitoring System**
   - **Description:** This project focused on developing a comprehensive system to monitor and assess water quality in real-time. The system utilized various sensors to collect data on water parameters such as pH, turbidity, temperature, and TDS. The data was then processed and analyzed to detect any anomalies or pollution levels that could pose risks to public health and the environment.
   - **Role:** I was responsible for the integration of sensors, data collection, analysis, and interpretation of the water quality parameters. I developed machine learning models to predict pollution levels and implemented a real-time alert system to notify authorities in case of hazardous water conditions.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, Machine Learning (Scikit-learn), IoT Sensors, Arduino, Pandas, Matplotlib.
   - **Outcome:** The system successfully monitored water quality in various locations, providing early detection of pollution events.
