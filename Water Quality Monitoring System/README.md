The main goal of this initiative is to cut down on water waste. One of the main concerns of the green globalization movement is water contamination. Real-time quality monitoring of the drinking water supply is necessary to guarantee its safety.Using a low-cost system for real-time water quality monitoring, the proposed work focuses on measurements of water quality. The system's several sensors are used to measure the water's chemical and physical characteristics. We have measured the parameters such as TDS, turbidity, PH, and temperature. The core controller has the ability to process the measured values obtained from the sensors. One possible usage for the Arduino model is as a core controller. Lastly, the sensor data is sent to the thingspeak.
